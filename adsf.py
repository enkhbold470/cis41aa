# Rewrite your pay computation program and use the following functions (get_input, compute_pay, print_output)
# 
# Don't forget to calculate overtime.
# 
# Enter Hours: 45
# 
# Enter Rate: 10
# 
# Pay: 475.0
# 
#  
# 
# YOU NEED THREE FUNCTIONS:
# the_hours, the_rate = get_input()
# 
# the_pay = compute_pay(the_hours, the_rate)
# 
# print_output(the_pay)
# 
#  
# 
# Call the functions and pass the arguments in the "main" function.
# 
# Example:
# 
# def main():
# 
#      the_hours, the_rate = get_input()
# 
#      the_pay = compute_pay(the_hours, the_rate)
# 
#      print_output(the_pay)
# 
#  
# 
# main()
# 
#  
#
